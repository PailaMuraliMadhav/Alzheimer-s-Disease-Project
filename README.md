Alzheimer's Disease Classification

Project Overview

This project aims to classify Alzheimer's disease cases using machine learning techniques. Various classification models were applied to analyze patient data and predict diagnoses based on features extracted from the dataset.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains patient records with various attributes. The target variable is Diagnosis, which indicates whether a patient has Alzheimer's disease. The dataset was pre-processed to remove unnecessary columns and convert categorical values where necessary.

Models Implemented

The following classification models were used:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Naive Bayes

Decision Tree

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Multiple Linear Regression (Converted to Classification)

Technology Stack

R: Programming language for data analysis and machine learning

caret, e1071, class, rpart, nnet: R packages for implementing machine learning models

Data Preprocessing: Feature selection, normalization, and handling missing values

Model Evaluation: Accuracy comparison among classification models

Project Workflow

Load Dataset: Read the dataset and clean data by removing unnecessary columns.

Pre-processing: Convert categorical variables, split data into training and testing sets.

Model Training: Train multiple classification models on the dataset.

Prediction & Evaluation: Evaluate model performance based on accuracy.

Comparison: Compare model results and analyze effectiveness.
